                            <u id="dlw">1.DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD </u><br>
                            Our planet is gifted with numerous living organisms, which vary in their size, shape, habitat, nutrition, reproduction and a lot more. Based on their physical features and their habitat, these animals of Kingdom Animale are classified into different order and class.
            <br>
            <u>Basis Of Classification</u><br>

                Over millions of years, we have seen diversity in living beings. We have evolved from ape-like beings to homo sapiens. We look for similarities between organisms so that we can classify them into classes and hence study them as a whole, for this, fundamental characteristics need to be decided which would form the foundation for classifying.<br>
                
                Classification can be carried out based on many factors such as:<br>
                
                   <br> Presence of nucleus
                
                  <br>  Body design – make up of cells(Single-celled or Multicellular organisms)
                
                   <br> Production of food
                
                   <br> Level of the organization in bodies of organisms carrying out photosynthesis
                
                   <br> In animals – an organization of one’s body parts, development of body, specialized organs for different functions
                
                <br>These features can differ in both plants and animals as they differ in their body design. Hence, these prominent designs and characteristic features can be used to make subgroups and not aa broad classification.<br>

                <u>Classification System</u><br>

                   <br> The classification system is of two types:
                    
                  <br> Two-Kingdom Classification- This system was proposed by Carolus Linnaeus who classified organisms into two types- plants and animals.
                    
                 <br>   Five-Kingdom Classification- This kingdom was proposed by H.Whittaker who divided the organisms into five different classes:
                    
                     <br>   Monera
                    
                     <br> Protista
                    
                     <br>   Fungi
                     <br>
                        Plantae
                        <br>
                        Animalia
                        <br> 
                   <u> Hierarchy of Classification</u><br>
                    
                    Carolus Linnaeus arranged the organisms into different taxonomic groups at different levels. The groups from top to bottom are:
                    <br>
                        Kingdom
                        <br>
                        Phylum
                        <br>
                        Class
                        <br>
                        Order
                        <br>
                        Family

                            Morphology is a branch of science that deals with the study of the external structure of plants. The flowering plant consists of shoot system, root system, and an axis.
                            Root System<br>
                            
                            The flowering plants consist of the lengthy cylindrical axis that is differentiated in an underground root system.<br>
                            
                            Root is the non-green descending underground part that lacks internodes, nodes, buds and leaves. The elongation in Dicotyledon plants leads to the formation of the primary root. The primary root grows in the soil and bears root lateral roots called as secondary roots, tertiary roots etc.<br>
                            <u>Types of Root System</u><br>
                            
                            The primary roots with its branches form a Tap Root system such as Mustard Plant. Primary roots have short life span and get replaced by larger roots later on.
                            <br>
                            The roots that arise from the bottom of the base are called as Fibrous Root system such as grasses and this kind of system is common to Mocotyledon plants. The roots that arise from the portion other than radicle is called as Adventitious Roots such as Monestra and Banyan tree.<br>
                      <img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jee/2017/03/06105127/Regions-of-the-Root.png"height="700px"><br>
                      <u>Regions of the Root</u><br>

The root consists of five major areas mentioned below.

<br>

    Root Cap is the structure which covers the apex of the root and helps in protecting the apex of the root.
    Meristematic Activity region is located a few millimeters over the root cap. The cells of this portion hold the property of iterative divisions that are required for the growth of plants.
    The portion of elongation is situated proximal to the area of meristematic activity which is required for root elongation.<br>
    The area of maturation is present proximal to the region of elongation and these cells differentiate and mature gradually. The root hairs rise from the matured region that helps in water absorption and minerals from the soil.
<br>
<u>Functions of the Root</u><br>

To provide appropriate anchorage to the plants.
<br>
To absorb minerals and water from the soil.
<br>
Synthesis of the plant growth.
<br>
To store reserved food elements.<br>
<u>Shoot System</u><br>

This is an aerial system over the soil and belongs from the plumule and consists of branches, stem, flowers, fruits and leaves.
 <br><u>Stem
</u><br>
It conducts minerals, water and food material and flowers, seeds and roots form the reproductive parts. The stem bears internodes and nodes. The point from which the leaf rises is called as the node and the part in between the nodes is called as internode.<br>

    <u id="pe">3.PLANT ECOLOGY</u><br>
    <u>
        What is Ecology?</u><br>
        
        Ecology is a  branch of science, including human science, population, community, ecosystem and biosphere. Ecology is the study of organisms, the environment and how the organisms interact with each other and their environment. It is studied at various levels, such as organism, population, community, biosphere and ecosystem.<br>
        
        An ecologist’s primary goal is to improve their understanding of life processes, adaptations and habitats, interactions and biodiversity of organisms.<br>
        
        Let us have a detailed look at the ecology notes provided here and explore the concept of ecology.
        Biotic and Abiotic Factors<br>
        
        The main aim of ecology is to understand the distribution of biotic and abiotic factors of living things in the environment. The biotic and abiotic factors include the living and non-living factors and their interaction with the environment.<br>
        <u>one Important concepts of Ecology</u><br>

Ecological hierarchy follows the below order with an increase in size and complexity
<br>
Organism → Species (population) → Biotic community → Ecosystem → Biome → Biosphere
<br>
Organism: is the smallest and basic unit of ecology. It includes all the living organisms, unicellular or multicellular having a fixed lifespan.<br>

Species or Population: members of the same species living in a specific geographical area. A species is a group of organisms that have a common gene pool and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring.
<br>
    Endemic species are found only in a particular area, e.g. kangaroos found in Australia
    Key-stone species is mostly a predator species, which is not present in large number but has a major influence on the characteristics of a community, e.g. lion in the forest.
    Critical Link species, which help other species in the vital activities, e.g. pollinators for plants, parasitic and symbiotic relationships.
<br>
Community: the interacting group of various different species living in an area, it includes plants, animals and microbes.
<br>
Ecosystem: it is the functional unit of the ecology. It includes the biotic community and the interacting physical environment associated with it. Biotic components and abiotic components constitute an ecosystem.
<br>
Biotic components include producers, consumers and decomposers.
<br>
Abiotic components include climatic conditions such as temperature, soil, water, air, light; inorganic and organic substances such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, carbohydrate, protein, lipid, etc.
<br>
Biome: consists of communities present in a large geographical area.
<br>
Biosphere: it is the total sum of all ecosystems. It is also known as the zone of life on Earth. It includes all the living organisms, their relationships and interaction with the elements of atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere.
<br>
Habitat: It is a natural environment of an organism where it grows, lives and reproduces. It is an ecological area best-suited for an organism. Habitats vary in the physical and chemical composition. It includes abiotic components like water, temperature, light and soil and biotic components too, e.g. parasites, competitors, pathogens and predators interacting with them constantly. Life exists not only in the most favourable habitat but also in the most extreme and harsh environment. Ecology at an organism level tries to understand how different species adapt to their environments for their survival and reproduction.
<br>
Niche: includes all the interaction of a species with the biotic and abiotic factors of its environment. Each species has a defined range of various abiotic factors that it can tolerate, a number of resources it utilises for survival and performs a specific functional role in an ecosystem, all these together form a niche, which is unique to a species.<br>

    <u id="ps">4.PLANT SYNTHESIS </u><br>
   <u> What is photosynthesis?</u><br>

    The process by which plants make food is photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process in which green plants use sunlight to make their own food. Photosynthesis requires sunlight, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide gas. Chlorophyll is a substance in all green plants, especially in the leaves. Plants take in water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air.  Autotrophs are the class of plants that are capable of preparing their own food.
    Various steps involved in the process of photosynthesis
    <br>
    Given below are the various steps involved in the process of photosynthesis.
    <br>
       
    Food in plants is synthesized in leaves hence they are often termed as food factories of the plant. Food production in leaves is as follows:
    <br>
       <br> Minerals and water in the soil is absorbed by roots and transported to leaves
    <br>    Atmospheric carbon dioxide enters the plants through stomata(small openings on the leaf surface)
       Leaves contain the pigment chlorophyll which helps the plant to capture solar energy which is used to synthesize food from water and carbon dioxide. This process of synthesis of food in the presence of sunlight is known as photosynthesis.
    <br>
    The reaction involved in photosynthesis
    <br>
    The process of photosynthesis can be represented as below in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight

<br>
<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reaction-of-photosynthesis.png"height="700px">
<br><u>Where does photosynthesis occur in plants?</u><br>

The organelle of plant cells in which photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of plant cells. The photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll is present in the chloroplast of the cell. It helps to absorb solar energy. It converts light energy into chemical energy and helps in the process of photosynthesis. The chloroplast organelle is present on the leaves of the plant.<br>

Also, the point to be noted is during the process of photosynthesis, all the parts of the plant are involved in this process. The root system and the shoot system both are involved. The shoot system of the plant includes the stem and leaves of the plant. As we all know that the photosynthesis process is carried out in the presence of sunlight. The pigment called chlorophyll has the ability to absorb sunlight’s energy. These are present in the chloroplast of the plant cell.<br>
<u>Importance of photosynthesis</u><br>

Photosynthesis plays a vital role in our environment. The whole life form is directly or indirectly dependent on the process of photosynthesis carried out by plants. If photosynthesis does not occur in plants then plants cannot synthesize the food. This causes an imbalance in the environment. The plants will not produce oxygen and then no animal life will be able to survive due to the absence of oxygen. We will not get oxygen, food, and life on this planet will be extinct.<br><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c158e7774b824e2ad01184078f27ffd"height="700px">

    <u id="b">5.BIOTECHNOLOGY </u><br>
    “Biotechnology is a wide discipline that harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies that help in improving the health and lives of the people.”

 <br>
   <u> What is Biotechnology?</u><br>
    
    Biotechnology is the field that exploits living organisms to make technological advances in various fields for the sustainable development of mankind. It has its applications in the medical as well as agricultural sectors. The biological processes of living organisms have been used for more than 6000 years to make essential products such as bread, cheese, alcohol, etc.
    <br>
    Let us have a look at the various types and applications of biotechnology in various fields.
<br>
    Biotechnology is divided into the following types:
    Medical Biotechnology
    <br>
    Medical biotechnology involves the use of living cells to develop technologies for the improvement of human health. It involves the use of these tools to find more efficient ways of maintaining human health. It also helps in the study of DNA to identify the causes of genetic disorders and methods to cure them.
    <br>
    Vaccines and antibiotics have been developed with the help of medical biotechnology that is essential for human health. Several plants are genetically engineered to produce antibodies with the help of biotechnology.
    Agricultural Biotechnology
    <br>
    This field deals with the development of genetically modified plants by introducing the gene of interest in the plant. This, in turn, helps in increasing the crop yield.
    <br>
    Various pest-resistant crops such as Bt-cotton and Bt-brinjal are created by transferring the genes from Bacillus thuringiensis into the plants.
    <br>
    The animals with the most desirable characteristics are bred together to obtain the offspring with the desired traits.<br>
    <u>Applications Of Biotechnology</u><br>

Following are the important applications of biotechnology:<br>
Nutrient Supplementation
<br>
Nutrients can be infused into food in situations of aid. e.g., Golden rice is prepared by the infusion of beta-carotene into the rice.<br>

Biotechnology helps in the production of crops that can handle abiotic stress such as cold, drought, salinity, etc. In the regions with extreme climatic conditions, such crops have proved beneficial in withstanding the harsh climate.
Industrial Biotechnology
<br>
Biotechnology involves the production of alcohol, detergents, cosmetic products, etc. It involves the production of biological elements and cellular structures for numerous purposes.
Strength Fibres
<br>
Spider webs have materials with the strongest tensile strength. The genes from the spiders have been picked up through biotechnological techniques and infused in goats to produce silk proteins in their milk. This helps in the production of silk easily.<br>
Biofuels<br>

Biotechnology is widely used in energy production. Due to the depletion of natural resources, there is a need to find an alternative source. Such fuels are produced by using biotechnology tools. These are environment friendly and do not release any greenhouse gas.<br>


Biotechnology is applied in the development of pharmaceuticals that had proven problematic when produced through conventional means due to purity concerns.<br>

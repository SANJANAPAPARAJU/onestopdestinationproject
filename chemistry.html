                                Solid-state is nothing but one of the states of matter. In our early days of schooling, we have learnt that matter exists in three states – solid, liquid and gas. However, as we progress from lower to higher classes the concepts get more advanced and there are more things to learn. In this lesson, we will be dealing with the concept of solid-state in a broader aspect and understand all the underlying terms including the properties as well as the types of solids.

Solids generally exhibit certain characteristics that set them apart from liquids and gases. For example, they have the ability to resist any force that is applied to its surface. However, the solid-state of compounds largely depends on the properties of atoms such as their arrangement and the forces acting between them.
<br><u>Physical and Chemical Properties of Solids</u>
<br>
Solids are incompressible, meaning the constituent particle is arranged close to each other and because of that, there is negligible space between the constituent particle.
Solids are rigid. This is due to lack of space between the constituent particles which make it rigid or fixed.
Solids have definite mass, volume and shape due to which it has a compact arrangement of constituent particles.
The intermolecular distance between molecules is short. Due to this, the force between the constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) is very strong.
The constituents particles can only oscillate about their mean positions.<br>
<u>Types of Solid States</u><br>

Based on the arrangement of constituent particles, solids are classified into two-state types:

  <br>  Crystalline Solids
    <br>Amorphous Solids

<br><u>Crystalline Solid State</u><br>

Crystalline solids are those that have a typical geometry.  In such type of solids, there are definite arrangements of particles (atoms, molecules or ions ) throughout the 3-dimensional network of a crystal in a long-range order. Examples include Sodium Chloride, Quartz, Diamond, etc.

<br><u>Properties of Crystalline Solids</u><br>

    <br>Crystalline solids have a sharp melting point and start melting when it reaches a particular temperature.
    <br>The shape of crystalline solids are definite and having typical arrangements of particles.
    <br>They show cleavage property i.e. when they are cut with the edge of a sharp tool they split into two pieces and the newly generated surfaces are smooth and plain.
    They have definite heat of fusion (amount of energy needed to melt a given mass of solid at its melting point).
   <br> Crystalline solids are anisotropic which means their physical properties like electrical resistance or refractive index show different values when they are measured along with <br>different directions in the same crystal.
   <br> Crystalline solids are true solids.

<br><u>Types of Crystalline Solids</u><br>

On the basis of the nature of intermolecular forces or chemical bonding, crystalline solids are further classified into four categories. They are,

   <br> Molecular Solids
    <br>Ionic solids
    <br>Metallic solids
    <br>Covalent solids

                    <u id="p-block">2.P-BLOCK ELEMENTS </u><br>
                    P block elements are those in which the last electron enters any of the three p-orbitals of their respective shells. Since a p-subshell has three degenerate p-orbitals each of which can accommodate two electrons, therefore in all there are six groups of p-block elements.

                    P block elements are shiny and usually a good conductor of electricity and heat as they have a tendency to lose an electron. You will find some amazing properties of elements in a P-block element like gallium. It’s a metal that can melt in the palm of your hand. Silicon is also one of the most important metalloids of the p-block group as it is an important component of glass.
                    
<br><img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Introduction-To-P-Block-Elements.png"height="700px"><br>
P block elements are nothing but the element in which the last electron enters the outermost p-subshell. P block starts from the 13th group and goes till the 18th group in the periodic table.

You must have seen that coal is used in villages to cook food. It is nothing but a P-block element i.e. carbon. Diamonds used for making beautiful ornaments are also made up of carbon. Aluminium foil made up of aluminium is also made up of the p block element.

    <u id="df">3.D AND F BLOCK ELEMENTS</u><br>
    The elements present in the middle of the periodic table from Group 3 to 12 are called d-block elements. The name d- blocks because the last electron enters into the d-orbital of the penultimate shell. <br>
    These are often called transition elements because their characters lie between highly reactive metallic elements of s-block and nonmetallic elements of p-block elements. There are four series in the d block corresponding to the filling up of 3d, 4d, 5d or 6d orbitals.
<br>
    First transition series or 3d series ( Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn)<br>
    Second transition series or 4d series (Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd)<br>
    Third transition series or 5d series (La, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg)<br>
    Fourth transition series or 6d series- incomplete.<br>
    f block elements are found outside at the bottom of the periodic table. The name f- blocks because the last electron enters into the f-orbital of the anti-penultimate shell.<br>

        <u id="hyd">4.HYDROGEN AND ITS COMPOUNDS</u><br>
        
       <u >What is Hydrogen?</u><br>

        To start the tour with the periodic table of elements, the first element to come across is Hydrogen, whose chemical symbol is H. It is the first and most basic among all the elements in the universe. It is also the lightest element in the periodic table, and 90% of all the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms.
        The chemist Lavoisier gives the name hydrogen. It got its name from the Greek word “hydro” meaning water. Lavoisier knew that it existed in every water molecule.
    <br>
    Preparation of Dihydrogen – H2<br>
    1. Laboratory Preparation of Dihydrogen<br>
    
   <br> (i) Typically, hydrogen is created when powdered zinc reacts with diluted hydrochloric acid.
    
    <br>Zn + 2H+ → Zn2+ + H2
    
    <br>(ii) Zinc and aqueous alkali can also be combined to create hydrogen. The reaction is given below:
    
    <br>Zn + 2NaOH → Na2ZnO2 + H2
    <br>2. Commercial Production of Dihydrogen

    <br>Below is a list of methods that are frequently used:
    
   <br> i) Using platinum electrodes, acidified water is electrolysed to produce hydrogen.
    Detailed Physical Properties of Hydrogen
    
       <br> It is a gas with no colour and odour and has the lowest density of all gases. It is seen as the clean fuel of the future, which is generated from water and returned to water when oxidized.
      <br>  It is present in water and in almost all molecules in living things. It remains bonded with carbon and oxygen atoms. It can be said that it is the most abundant element in the universe.
       <br> It is present as a gas in the atmosphere in one part per million volumes. Hydrogen is spotless and is non-toxic and safe to produce from various different sources, transport, and store in large amounts.
       <br> It is named an energy carrier because it stores energy which is first created somewhere else.
        <br>This element was artificially produced in the 16th century. It was named as hydrogen whose Greek name is ‘water-former’
    
    <br>(ii) By electrolysing brine solution, it is produced as a byproduct in the production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine. The reactions that take place during electrolysis are:
    
   <br> At anode: 2Cl–(aq) → Cl2(g) + 2e–
  <br>  At cathode: 2H2O(l) + 2e– → H2(g) + 2OH–(aq)
    
    <br>The overall reaction is
    
   <br> 2Na+ (aq) + 2Cl– (aq) + 2H2O(l) → Cl2 (g) + H2 (g) + 2Na+ (aq) + 2OH– (aq)

<br>Uses of Hydrogen<br>

Ammonia synthesis is the most significant use of hydrogen.<br>
A large amount of hydrogen is consumed in the catalytic hydrogenation of vegetable oils to extract solid fat.<br>
<br>It is also consumed as rocket fuel when combined with oxygen, and as a rocket propellant by nuclear energy.
<br>Hydrogen is burnt as a fuel to burn in internal combustion engines.

        <u id="s">5.S-BLOCK ELEMENTS</u><br>
     
        The elements of Group 1 and Group 2 of the modern periodic table are called S-block elements. Two types of s block elements are possible i.e. the elements with one electron (s1) or the elements with two electrons (s2) in their s-subshell.<br>

        S-block comprises 14 elements namely hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), helium (He), sodium (Na), beryllium (Be), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), rubidium (Rb), calcium (Ca), cesium (Cs), strontium (Sr), francium (Fr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).<br>
        The s-block elements having only one electron in their s-orbital are called group one or alkali metals whereas the s block elements having two electrons filling their s-orbital are called group two or alkaline earth metals.
<br>
The electrons present in an atom occupy various sub-orbitals of available energy levels in the order of increasing energy. The last electron of an atom may find itself in either of the s, p, d and f subshells. Accordingly, the elements of the atom having their last valence electron present in the s-suborbital are called the s block elements.<br>

<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/S-Block-Elements-for-IIT-JEE-1.png"height="700px"><br>
<u>Properties of S-Block Elements</u><br>

Both alkali and alkaline earth elements show a regular gradation in their properties among their respective group elements. But the first member of both S block elements, namely, Lithium and Beryllium differ much from the rest of their members but at the same time, they resemble more with the diagonal element present in the next column.
<br>
The anomaly of these S-block elements is due to;<br>

   <br> Low atomic and ionic size
 <br>   Greater charge density (charge/volume of the atom)
   <br> Greater polarization
  <br>  Absence of d-orbitals.

<br>Greater polarization of s block elements makes the first element more covalent and differentiates them from the rest which are ionic.
<br>
The similarity in size and charge density makes them resemble the element diagonally placed in the next group (diagonal relationship).
<br>
It is observed that the physical and chemical properties of these s block elements change in a particular trend as the atomic number of the elements increases.<br>

    <br>
    <u>Characteristics of p-Block Elements</u><br>

    The general electronic configuration of p-block elements is ns2np1-6(except He). Whereas the inner core electronic configuration may differ. Just because of this difference in the inner core, there are changes in both physical and chemical properties of the elements.
    The oxidation state of elements in p – block is maximum when it is equal to a total number of valence electrons i.e. the sum of S and P electrons. One of the most interesting facts about the p-block elements is that it contains both non-metals and metalloids.
<br>
The first member of the p block elements differs from other elements in two major respects:
<br>
    First is the size and each and every property which depends upon the size.
    The second difference applies only to the p-block element, which arises from the effects of d-orbitals in the valence shell of heavier elements.

    <u id="oc">7.ORGANIC CHEMISTRY</u><br>
 
  <u>  What is Organic Chemistry?</u>
<br>
    Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that involves the scientific study of organic compounds (compounds that contain covalently bonded carbon atoms). This branch of chemistry primarily deals with the structure and chemical composition of organic compounds, the physical and chemical properties of organic compounds, and the chemical reactions undergone by these compounds. Advancements in the field of organic chemistry have made numerous contributions to human society, such as the synthesis of several drugs, polymers, and other natural products. Synthetic organic chemistry is an important application of organic chemistry that deals with the design and construction of organic compounds for practical purposes.
    <br>
    The term  ‘organic’ was coined because the field of organic chemistry was initially finite to compounds that were produced by living organisms. This was attributed to some ‘vital force’ that was present in organic substances as they had something that inanimate substances lacked. The above theory was debunked when Urey Miller synthesized urea from inorganic substances but the classification is still in use.<br>
<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Classification-of-Organic-Compounds.png"height="700px">
<br>
<u>1. Acyclic or Open Chain Compounds:</u>
<br>
    These compounds are also known as aliphatic compounds, they have branched or straight chains. Following are the examples in this category.
    <br>
    <img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Examples-of-Acyclic-or-open-chain-compounds.png"height="700px">
    <br>
    <u>2. Alicyclic or Closed Chain or Ring Compounds:</u><br>

        These are cyclic compounds which contain carbon atoms connected to each other in a ring (homocyclic). When atoms other than carbon are also present then it is called heterocyclic. Examples of this type are as follows:<br>

<br><u>3. Aromatic Compounds</u><br>

    They are a special type of compound which contains benzene and other ring related compounds. Similar to alicyclic, they can also have heteroatoms in the ring. Such compounds are called heterocyclic aromatic compounds. Some examples are as follows:

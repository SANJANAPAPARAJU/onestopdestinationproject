        <h1><u>VARIABLES</u></h1>
       Variables are containers for storing data values.
<br>
In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
<br>
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123<br>
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99<br>
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes<br>

<br>
<h1><u>CONSTANTS</u></h1><br>
C Constant is the most fundamental and essential part of the C programming language. Constants in C are the fixed values used in a program, and their value remains the same during the entire program execution.<br>

Constants are also called literals.<br>
Constants can be any of the data types.<br>
It is considered best practice to define constants using only upper-case names.<br>

    <h1><u>DATA TYPES</u></h1><br>
    Each variable in C has an associated data type. Each data type requires different amounts of memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it. <br>It specifies the type of data that the variable can store like integer, character, floating, double, etc.<br> The data type is a collection of data with values having fixed values, meaning as well as its characteristics. <br>

        <h1><u>OPERATORS</u></h1><br>
        An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators.<br>

Arithmetic Operators<br>
Relational Operators<br>
Logical Operators<br>
Bitwise Operators<br>
Assignment Operators<br>

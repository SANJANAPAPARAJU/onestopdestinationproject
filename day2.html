        <h1><u>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</u></h1>
      
      <BR>
        Conditional statements help you to make a decision based on certain conditions. These conditions are specified by a set of conditional statements having boolean expressions which are evaluated to a boolean value of true or false.<BR>

        In our life, we frequently encounter certain situations where we have to make a decision be it your favorite food, movie, hobby, or the color of our shoes.<BR> In C programming also, you may encounter similar kinds of situations where you need to make a decision based on the two possibilities that are yes/no or true/false acceptance, we will learn all about the conditional statements in this article.<BR>
        
        There are the following types of conditional statements in C.<BR>
        
        If statement<BR>
        
        If-Else statement<BR>
        
        Nested If-else statement<BR>
        
        If-Else If ladder<BR>
        
        Switch statement<BR>

<h1><u>LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS</u></h1><br>
Consider the expression that says, “If a thing is worth doing, then it is worth doing multiple times.” <br>There are various real-life examples of this statement- like riding a horse, watching a movie, eating your favourite meal, wearing the same clothes, etc.<br> Similarly, in programming, we sometimes have to perform the very same action/ program over and over again. This need is met by a mechanism known as the loop. <br>Sometimes, users would want to break out of any given loop. It is known as loop control.<br>

The loop control statements help in changing the execution of a loop from its original sequence. Whenever the execution of the control statement takes place in a loop, the loop leaves the scope. <br>Thus, in this case, all the objects created automatically in the scope will get ultimately destroyed in no time.<br>


Types of Loops in C<br>
We can handle various looping requirements in the C programming language with the use of the following types of loops:
<br>
while loop<br>
nested loop<br>
for loop<br>
do-while loop<br>

<BR>
    <h1><u>BREAK,CONTINUE</u></h1><br>


    In any loop break is used to jump out of loop skipping the code below it without caring about the test condition.
<br>
It interrupts the flow of the program by breaking the loop and continues the execution of code which is outside the loop.<br>
Like a break statement, continue statement is also used with if condition inside the loop to alter the flow of control.<br>

When used in while, for or do...while loop, it skips the remaining statements in the body of that loop and performs the next iteration of the loop.<br>

Unlike break statement, continue statement when encountered doesn&quot;t terminate the loop, rather interrupts a particular iteration.<br>

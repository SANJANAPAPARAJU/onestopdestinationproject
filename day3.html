        <h1><u>FUNCTIONS</u></h1>
      
      <br>
        A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
        <br>
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
<br>
Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
<br>
<h1>Create a Function</h1>
To create (often referred to as declare) your own function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses () and curly brackets {}: <br>

Syntax <br>
void myFunction() { <br>
  // code to be executed <br>
} <br>
Example Explained <br>
myFunction() is the name of the function <br>
void means that the function does not have a return value.  <br>

Call a Function <br>
Declared functions are not executed immediately. <br> They are "saved for later use", and will be executed when they are called. <br>

To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ; <br>

In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called: <br>

Example <br>
Inside main, call myFunction():
<br>
// Create a function
<br>void myFunction() {
    <br> printf("I just got executed!");
}
<br>
int main() {
    <br>myFunction(); // call the function
    <br>return 0;
} <br>
<br> <br> <br>
// Outputs "I just got executed!" <br>
A function can be called multiple times: <br>
<br>
Example <br>
void myFunction() { <br>
  printf("I just got executed!");
  <br>}
  <br>
int main() { <br>
  myFunction(); <br>
  myFunction(); <br>
  myFunction(); <br>
  return 0; <br>
} <br>

// I just got executed! <br>
// I just got executed! <br>
// I just got executed! <br>

    <h1><u>RECURSION</u></h1><br>
    ecursion is the technique of making a function call itself. <br>This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.<br>

    Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.<br>
    
    Recursion Example<br>
    Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. <br>In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:<br>
    
    Example<br>
    int sum(int k);<br>
    
    int main() {<br>
      int result = sum(10);<br>
      printf("%d", result);<br>
      return 0;<br>
    }<br>
    
    int sum(int k) {<br>
      if (k > 0) {<br>
        return k + sum(k - 1);<br>
      } else {<br>
        return 0;<br>
      }<br>
    }<br>
    Example Explained<br>
    When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the result.<br> When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps:
    <br>
    10 + sum(9)<br>
    10 + ( 9 + sum(8) )<br>
    10 + ( 9 + ( 8 + sum(7) ) )<br>
    ...
    10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + sum(0)<br>
    10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0<br>
    Since the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result.<br>
    
    The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. <br>However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.<br>

        <h1><u>POINTERS</u></h1><br>
        Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. <br>So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. <br>Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
        <br>
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined <br>
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. 
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned.<br> This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.<br>
Pointer Expressions and Pointer Arithmetic<br>
 A limited set of arithmetic operations can be performed on pointers.<br> The Pointer Arithmetic is slightly different from the ones that we generally use for mathematical calculations. <br>The operations are: <br>

Increment/Decrement of a Pointer<br>
Addition of integer to a pointer<br>
Subtraction of integer to a pointer<br>
Subtracting two pointers of the same type.<br>
Comparison of pointers of the same type.<br>

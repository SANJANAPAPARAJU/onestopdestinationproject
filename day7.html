        <h1><u>FILES</u></h1><br>
        When a program is terminated, the entire data is lost. Storing in a file will preserve your data even if the program terminates.<br>
        If you have to enter a large number of data, it will take a lot of time to enter them all.<br>
        However, if you have a file containing all the data, you can easily access the contents of the file using a few commands in C.<br>
        You can easily move your data from one computer to another without any changes.<br>
        When dealing with files, there are two types of files you should know about:<br>

        Text files<br>
        Binary files<br>
        1. Text files<br>
        Text files are the normal .txt files. You can easily create text files using any simple text editors such as Notepad.<br>
        
        When you open those files, you'll see all the contents within the file as plain text. You can easily edit or delete the contents.
        <br>
    
        They take minimum effort to maintain, are easily readable, and provide the least security and takes bigger storage space.
        <br>
        2. Binary files
        <br>Binary files are mostly the .bin files in your computer.
        <br>
        Instead of storing data in plain text, they store it in the binary form (0's and 1's).
        <br>
        They can hold a higher amount of data, are not readable easily, and provides better security than text files.
        <br>
        File Operations
        <br>In C, you can perform four major operations on files, either text or binary:
        <br>
        Creating a new file<br>
        Opening an existing file<br>
        Closing a file<br>
        Reading from and writing information to a file.<br>

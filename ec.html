                                    Direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) are the two main types of electricity.<br> DC circuit and AC circuit show the structure of the respective circuit systems. <br>Elements of a DC circuit are mainly resistive, which contains a DC battery, a switch, ammeter, voltmeter, a load lamp and connecting leads.
                                    <br>
<br>Direct current refers to the unidirectional propagation of electric charge. It is commonly used in batteries and solar cells. Thomas Edison invented DC current, which allowed him to power numerous complex electrical systems.<br>

DC Circuit Types<br>
Every electrical circuit can be classified into three groups &minus; series, series-parallel and parallel. Thus, DC circuits can be divided into three categories: series DC circuit, series and parallel DC circuit, and parallel DC circuit.
<br>
Series DC Circuit<br>
When components are connected end to end, they are called a series circuit. In series DC circuits, resistive elements are connected in an end to end way, creating a linear path for flowing current.<br>

Here, resistors R1, R2 and R3 are attached in series over a voltage source of V volts. Electrical current &quot;I&quot; is running through the given resistors.
<br>
Parallel DC Circuit
<br>When multiple electrical components are attached in parallel, one end of each element is attached to a common point, and the other end is attached to a different common point. Here one end of all resistors are connected to a common point, and the remaining ends are connected to another common point (current flows through them).
<br>
All the components will have an equal voltage drop over them, and it will be equivalent to the voltage between the two common joints where the components are joined.

    <u id="acc"> 2.AC CIRCUITS</u><br>
    
    Direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) are the two types of electricity. DC circuit and AC circuit show the structure of the respective circuit systems.<br>

The main components of AC circuits are resistors, capacitors, and inductors.<br>

All these passive electrical elements have one property in common; they restrict electric current in a circuit coil but in completely different ways.<br>

The voltages and currents are marked by direction and magnitude in an AC circuit. The alternating values may or may not be in phase with each other, relying on the different variables of the system like capacitance, inductance and resistance. The sinusoidal alternating values are current and voltage, which differ by cohering to the sine of angle θ.<br>
An alternating current (AC) is an electrical current that regularly reverses direction and changes its value constantly with time, contrary to DC current, which travels only in a single direction.
<br>
For many decades of electric power, the sinusoidal current and voltage have been used in power businesses and homes.

        <u id="mcc">3.MAGNETIC CIRCUITS</u><br>
        A magnetic circuit is defined as a closed path followed by the magnetic flux.<br>

A magnetic circuit consists of a core of materials having high permeability like iron, soft steel etc. It is because these materials offer very small opposition to the flow of magnetic flux.<br>

Consider a coil of N turns wound on an iron core (see the figure). When an electric current I is passes through the coil, magnetic flux (ψ) is set up in the core. This magnetic flux follows a closed path ABCDA and hence ABCDA is the magnetic circuit.<br>
MMF=NI=Ampere&minus;Turns<br>
Series Magnetic Circuit<br>
When the same magnetic flux ψ flows through each part of the magnetic circuit, then the circuit is called as series magnetic circuit.<br>

Consider a composite series magnetic circuit (a series magnetic circuit that has parts of different dimensions and materials is called a composite series magnetic circuit) consisting of two different magnetic materials of different relative permeability.<br> Each part of this series magnetic circuit will offer reluctance to the magnetic flux ψ. Since the different parts of the magnetic circuit are in series, the total reluctance is equal to the sum of reluctances of individual parts.<br>

            <u id="dcm">4.DC MACHINES</u><br>

            What is a DC Machine?<br>
A DC machine is an electromechanical device that is used to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy or vice versa.<br>

The DC machine used to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, which is known as DC motor and the DC machine used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is known as DC generator. The same machine can be used either as a motor or generator. The construction is same for DC motor and DC generator.
<br>
Working of DC Machine
<br>The working principle and operation of a DC machine is based on an effect when a current carrying conductor coils laying in a magnetic field, the magnetic field produces a mechanical force on it known as torque which rotates the conductor coils in magnetic field. The direction of this produced torque can be found by the Fleming’s left hand rule (thumb is the force).
<br>
Construction of DC Machine
<br>The DC machine consists of Yoke, Pole, and Pole shoe, Armature core, Field Winding, Armature Winding, Commutator, Brushes, shaft, and Bearings. Let’s explain each part in detail with applications.The yoke is used to provides mechanical protection to the machine. The second application of yoke is that it provides a low reluctance path to the flux. So, flux completes its path through the yoke.
<br>
Pole and Pole shoe
<br>The field winding is placed on a pole. When current passes through the field winding, it will create an electric magnetic field and behaves as an electromagnet. The pole shoes expand flux in the entire machine.
<br>
To reduce the eddy current losses, the pole and pole shoes are laminated. For a small machine, the pole is not necessary to laminate. It is made up of thin cast steel.
<br>
The pole is used to provide housing for the field winding and produce magnetic flux inside the machine. The pole shoes are used to provide support to the field winding and not to slip from the pole.
<br>Field Winding
<br>It is winding wounded on the pole is known as the field winding. External DC source or the output of the machine is used to excite the field winding.
<br>
It is made up of copper and aluminum. In most of the case, the winding is made up of copper but when the cost is a consideration, aluminum is used.
<br>
When DC current passes through the coil, it will generate the electromagnetic field (EMF). And it will magnetize the pole and produce the magnetic flux. The flux produced by the pole is directly proportional to the field current. And flux is more enough to cross the air gap between armature and pole shoes.
<br>
Armature Core
<br>The armature core is cylindrical in shape and connected by a key with the shaft. So, it is a rotating part of the DC machine.

                    <u id="acg">5.AC GENERATOR</u><br>
                    AC generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The AC Generator&quot;s input supply is mechanical energy supplied by steam turbines, gas turbines and combustion engines. The output is alternating electrical power in the form of alternating voltage and current.<br>

                    AC generators work on the principle of Faraday&quot;s law of electromagnetic induction, which states that electromotive force &minus; EMF or voltage &minus;is generated in a current-carrying conductor that cuts a uniform magnetic field. This can either be achieved by rotating a conducting coil in a static magnetic field or rotating the magnetic field containing the stationary conductor. The preferred arrangement is to keep the coil stationary because it is easier to draw induced alternating current from a stationary armature coil than from a rotating coil.
                    <br>
                    The generated EMF depends on the number of armature coil turns, magnetic field strength, and the speed of the rotating field.<br>
                    he various parts of an AC generator are:<br>

Field<br>
Armature<br>
Prime Mover<br>
Rotor<br>
Stator<br>
Slip Rings<br>

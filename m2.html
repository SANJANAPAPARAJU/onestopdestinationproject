                                    A first-order differential equation is defined by an equation: dy/dx =f (x,y) of two variables x and y with its function f(x,y) defined on a region in the xy-plane. It has only the first derivative dy/dx so that the equation is of the first order and no higher-order derivatives exist. The differential equation in first-order can also be written as;

y’ = f (x,y)   or

(d/dx) y = f (x,y)

The differential equation is generally used to express a relation between the function and its derivatives. In Physics and chemistry, it is used as a technique for determining the functions over its domain if we know the functions and some of the derivatives.
First Order Linear Differential Equation
If the function f is a linear expression in y, then the first-order differential equation y’ = f (x, y) is a linear equation. That is, the equation is linear and the function f takes the form

f(x,y) = p(x)y + q(x)

Since the linear equation is y = mx+b

where p and q are continuous functions on some interval I. Differential equations that are not linear are called nonlinear equations.

Consider the first-order differential equation y’ = f (x,y),  is a linear equation and it can be written in the form

y’ + a(x)y = f(x)
where a(x) and f(x) are continuous functions of x

The alternate method to represent the first-order linear equation in a reduced form is

(dy/dx) + P(x)y = Q (x)

Where P(x) and Q(x) are the functions of x which are the continuous functions. If P(x) or Q(x) is equal to zero, the differential equation is reduced to the variable separable form. It is easy to solve when the differential equations are in variable separable form.

Types of First Order Differential Equations
There are basically five types of differential equations in the first order. They are:

Linear Differential Equations
Homogeneous Equations
Exact Equations
Separable Equations
Integrating Factor

        A multiple integral is a generalization of the usual integral in one dimension to functions of multiple variables in higher-dimensional spaces,which is an integral of a function over a two-dimensional region. The most common multiple integrals are double and triple integrals, involving two or three variables, respectively. Since the world has three spatial dimensions, many of the fundamental equations of physics involve multiple integration (e.g. with respect to each spatial variable)

            Vector Calculus Definition
            Vector Calculus, also known as vector analysis, deals with the differentiation and integration of vector field, especially in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. Vector fields represent the distribution of a vector to each point in the subset of space. In Euclidean Space, the vector field on a domain is represented as a vector-valued function that compares the n-tuple of real numbers to each point on the domain. Vector analysis is an analysis which deals with the quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Vector calculus deals with two integrals such as line integrals and surface integrals.
            
            Line Integral
            In Vector Calculus, a line integral of a vector field is defined as an integral of some function along a curve. In simple words, a line integral is an integral in which the function to be integrated is calculated along with a curve. We can integrate some specific type of vector-valued functions along with a curve. For example, we can also integrate a scalar-valued function along a curve. Sometimes, a line integral is also known as a path integral, or curve integral or curvilinear integrals.
            
            Surface Integral
            In calculus, a surface integral is defined as a generalisation of several integrals to the integrations over surfaces. It means that we can think about the double integral related to the line integral. For any given surface, we can integrate a scalar field over a surface or a vector field over a surface.
            
            Vector Calculus Formulas
            Some of the important vector calculus formulas are given below:
            
            From fundamental theorems, we take,
            
            F(x, y, z) = P(x, y, z)i + Q(x, y, z)j + R(x, y, z)k
            
            Fundamental Theorem of Line Integral
            If F = ∇f and curve C has endpoints A and B, then
            
            ∫c F. dr= f(B) − f(A).

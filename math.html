                                        We can define a function as a special relation which maps each element of set A with one and only one element of set B. Both the sets A and B must be non-empty. A function defines a particular output for a particular input. Hence, f: A → B is a function such that for a ∈ A there is a unique element b ∈ B such that (a, b) ∈ f.<br><br>
                                       <u> One to One Function</u><br>

A function f: A → B is One to One if for each element of A there is a distinct element of B. It is also known as Injective. Consider if a1 ∈ A and a2 ∈ B, f is defined as f: A → B such that f (a1) = f (a2).</br><br>
<u>Many to One Function</u><br>



It is a function which maps two or more elements of A to the same element of set B. Two or more elements of A have the same image in B.
<br><br>
<u>Onto Function</u><br>

If there exists a function for which every element of set B there is (are) pre-image(s) in set A, it is Onto Function. Onto is also referred as Surjective Function.<br><br>
<u>One – One and Onto Function</u><br>

A function, f is One – One and Onto or Bijective if the function f is both One to One and Onto function. In other words, the function f associates each element of A with a distinct element of B and every element of B has a pre-image in A.

    <u id="matrices">2.MATRICES </u><br>
   

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, variables, symbols, or expressions that are defined for the operations like subtraction, addition, and multiplications. The size of a matrix (which is known as the order of the matrix) is determined by the number of rows and columns in the matrix. The order of a matrix with 6 rows and 4 columns is represented as a 6 &times; 4 and is read as 6 by 4. For example, the given matrix B is a 3 &times; 4 matrix and is written as [B]3&times;4

<!-- B=⎡⎣2−13505271−1−29⎤⎥⎦ -->

    <u id="vectors">3.VECTORS </u><br>
    A vector is a Latin word that means carrier. Vectors carry a point A to point B. The length of the line between the two points A and B is called the magnitude of the vector and the direction of the displacement of point A to point B is called the direction of the vector AB. Vectors are also called Euclidean vectors or Spatial vectors. Vectors have many applications in maths, physics, engineering, and various other fields.<br>
<img src="https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/vectors-definition-1622802290.png"height="700px">



The magnitude of a vector can be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. If (x,y,z) are the components of a vector A, then the magnitude formula of A is given by,

|A| = √ (x2+y2+z2)

The magnitude of a vector is a scalar value.
<br>
The angle between two vectors can be calculated using the dot product formula. Let us consider two vectors a and b and the angle between them to be θ. Then, the dot product of two vectors is given by a·b = |a||b| cosθ. We need to determine the value of the angle θ. The angle between two vectors also indicates the directions of the two vectors. θ can be evaluated using the following formula:<br>

θ = cos-1[(a·b)/|a||b|]<br>

    <u id="trig">4.TRIGONOMETRY </u><br>
    Trigonometry is one of the most important branches in mathematics. The word trigonometry is formed by clubbing words 'Trigonon' and 'Metron' which means triangle and measure respectively. It is the study of the relation between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. It thus helps in finding the measure of unknown dimensions of a right-angled triangle using formulas and identities based on this relationship.

    <u id="locus">5.LOCUS </u><br>
    Locus" basically means a shape or a curve.

We know that any shape or curve is formed by a set of points.

So "Locus" is a set of points.

In math, the locus is a set of points that satisfy a set of rules.
<br>
The locus of the set of all points that are at a fixed distance from a fixed point is called a circle.

Here,

    The fixed-point is called the "center" of the circle
    The fixed-distance is called the "radius" of the circle

    <u id="diff">6.DIFFERENTIATION </u><br>
    Differentiation means the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another. The speed is calculated as the rate of change of distance with respect to time. This speed at each instant is not the same as the average calculated. Speed is the same as the slope, which is nothing but the instantaneous rate of change of the distance over a period of time.

The ratio of a small change in one quantity with a small change in another which is dependent on the first quantity is called differentiation. One of the important concepts in calculus is mainly focused on the differentiation of a function. The maximum or minimum value of a function, the velocity and acceleration of moving objects, and the tangent of a curve are determined by differentiation. If y = f(x) that is differentiable, then the differentiation is represented as f'(x) or dy/dx.

    <u id="cn">7.COMPLEX NUMBERS </u><br>
    A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number. A complex number is of the form a + ib and is usually represented by z. Here both a and b are real numbers. The value 'a' is called the real part which is denoted by Re(z), and 'b' is called the imaginary part Im(z).  Also, ib is called an imaginary number.

<img src="https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/complex-numbers-1622532185.png"height="700px">The alphabet i is referred to as the iota and is helpful to represent the imaginary part of the complex number. Further the iota(i) is very helpful to find the square root of negative numbers. We have the value of i2 = -1, and this is used to find the value of √-4 = √i24 = +2i  The value of i2 = -1 is the fundamental aspect of a complex number. Let us try and understand more about the increasing powers of i.

<br>i = √-1
<br>i2 = -1
<br>i3  = i.i2 = i(-1) = -i
<br>i4 = (i2)2 = (-1)2 = 1
<br>i4n = 1
<br>i4n + 1 = i
<br>i4n + 2 = -1
<br>i4n + 3 = -i

    <u id="pc">8.PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATION </u><br>
    Permutation and combination are the methods employed in counting how many outcomes are possible in various situations. Permutations are understood as arrangements and combinations are understood as selections. As per the fundamental principle of counting, there are the sum rules and the product rules to employ counting easily.

    Suppose there are 14 boys and 9 girls. If a boy or a girl has to be selected to be the monitor of the class, the teacher can select 1 out of 14 boys or 1 out of 9 girls. She can do it in 14 + 9 = 23 ways(using the sum rule of counting). Let us look at another scenario. Suppose Sam usually takes one main course and a drink. Today he has the choice of burger, pizza, hot dog, watermelon juice, and orange juice. What are all the possible combinations that he can try? There are 3 snack choices and 2 drink choices. We multiply to find the combinations. 3 × 2 = 6. Thus Sam can try 6 combinations using the product rule of counting. This can be shown using tree diagrams as illustrated below.
    
    <img src="https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/permutations-and-combinations-1620278754.png"height="700px">
    <br>
    combination is all about grouping. The number of different groups which can be formed from the available things can be calculated using combinations. Let us try to understand this with a simple example. A team of 2 is formed from 5 students(William, James, Noah, Logan, and Oliver). This the combination of 'r' persons from the available 'n' persons is given as nCr=n!r!.(n−r)!

    The combinations can happen in the following 10 ways by which the team of 2 could be formed.
    
        <br>William James
        <br>William Noah
        <br> William Logan
        <br>William Oliver
        <br> James Noah
        <br>James Logan
        <br>   James Oliver
        <br>Logan Noah
        <br>Logan Oliver
        <br>Oliver Noah
        <br>
    This is a simple example of combinations. C(5,2) = 10.

    <u id="int">9.INTERGRATION </u><br>
    Integration is the process of finding the area of the region under the curve. This is done by drawing as many small rectangles covering up the area and summing up their areas. The sum approaches a limit that is equal to the region under the curve of a function. Integration is the process of finding the antiderivative of a function. If a function is integrable and if its integral over the domain is finite, with the limits specified, then it is the definite integration.

    Sometimes, the inspection is not enough to find the integral of some functions. There are additional methods to reduce the function in the standard form to find its integral. Prominent methods are discussed below.

The methods of integration are:

   <br> Decomposition method
    <br>Integration by Substitution
    <br>Integration using Partial Fractions
    <br>Integration by Parts

If an object changes its position with respect to its surroundings with time, then it is called in motion. It is a change in the position of an object over time. Motion in a straight line is nothing but linear motion. As the name suggests, it’s in a particular straight line, thus it can be said that it uses only one dimension.<br>
<br><u>Types of Linear Motion</u>

The linear motion, also called the Rectilinear Motion can be of two types:

   <br> Uniform linear motion with constant velocity or zero acceleration
    <br>Non-Uniform linear motion with variable velocity or non-zero acceleration

Linear motion is the most straightforward kind of one-dimensional motion. As Newton’s first law of motion suggests, an object will either be at rest or continue to move in a straight line with a uniform velocity unless and until an external force is applied to it.

You are suggested not to confuse linear motion with general motion. As we discussed, linear motion is a one-dimensional motion. Still, in general, the motion has magnitude and direction both, i.e. an object’s position and velocity are described in vector quantities.
Uniform Motion in a Straight Line

If a body travels in a straight line and covers an equal amount of distance in an equal interval of time, it is said to have uniform motion. In simple words, a body is said to have uniform acceleration if the rate of change of its velocity remains constant.<br>

    <u id="mp">2.MOTION IN A PLANE </u><br>
    Motion in a plane is the motion in 2 dimensions, for instance, projectile motion, circular motion and so on. The reference to analyze a 2 Dimensional motion, will be the origin with two coordinate axes i.e X and Y.<br>
    The physical quantities like work, temperature and distance can be represented in day to day life wholly by their magnitude alone. However, the relation of these physical quantities can be explained by the laws of arithmetic. In order to represent physical quantities like acceleration, displacement, and force, the direction is equally essential along with the magnitude.<br>

        <u id="lm">3.LAWS OF MOTION </u><br>
        Newton’s First Law of Motion

Newton’s first law of motion implies that things cannot start, stop, or change direction all by themselves, and it requires some force from the outside to cause such a change. This property of massive bodies to resist changes in their state of motion is called inertia. The first law of motion is also known as the law of inertia.

    Newton’s 1st law states that a body at rest or uniform motion will continue to be at rest or uniform motion until and unless a net external force acts on it.

The crucial point here is that if there is no net force resulting from unbalanced forces acting on an object, the object will maintain a constant velocity. If that velocity is zero, then the object remains at rest. And if an additional external force is applied, the velocity will change because of the force.

<br>
Newton’s Second Law of Motion

Newton’s second law of motion describes what happens to the massive body when acted upon by an external force. The second law of motion states that the force acting on the body is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration.

    Newton’s 2nd law states that the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the object’s mass.<br>
    Newton’s third law of motion describes what happens to the body when it exerts a force on another body.

    Newton’s 3rd law states that there is an equal and opposite reaction for every action.<br>

            <u id="waves">4.WAVES </u><br>
            A wave is a disturbance in a medium that carries energy without a net movement of particles. It may take the form of elastic deformation, a variation of pressure, electric or magnetic intensity, electric potential, or temperature.<br>
           <u> Introduction of Waves</u><br>

    Transfers energy.
    Usually involves a periodic, repetitive movement.
    Does not result in a net movement of the medium or particles in the medium (mechanical wave).

<img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Wave-1.png"height="700px">There are some basic descriptors of a wave. Wavelength is the distance between two successive identical parts of the wave. Amplitude is the maximum displacement from the neutral position. This represents the energy of the wave. Greater amplitude carries greater energy. Displacement is the position of a particular point in the medium as it moves as the wave passes. Maximum displacement is the amplitude of the wave

Frequency (ƒ) is the number of repetitions per second in Hz, Period (T) is the time for one wavelength to pass a point.

The velocity (v) of the wave is the speed at which a specific part of the wave passes a point. The speed of a light wave is c.

                    An alternating current can be defined as a current that changes its magnitude and polarity at regular intervals of time. It can also be defined as an electrical current that repeatedly changes or reverses its direction opposite to that of Direct Current or DC which always flows in a single direction as shown below.

    <u id="atom">6.ATOMS </u><br>
 
    What is an Atom?

    Atoms are defined as “the basic building blocks of matter”. 

It is the smallest constituent unit of matter that possess the properties of the chemical element. Atoms don’t exist independently, instead, they form ions and molecules which further combine in large numbers to form matter that we see, feel and touch.<br>
toms are much too small to be seen; hence experiments to find out their structure and behavior have to be conducted with large numbers of them. From the results of these experiments we may attempt to construct a hypothetical model of an atom that behaves like the true atom.

Molecules consist of one or more atoms bound together by covalent (chemical) bonds. Atoms may be depicted by circle shapes, each of which has a nucleus at the center (containing protons and neutrons), surrounded by one or more concentric circles representing the ‘shells’ or ‘levels’ in which the electrons surrounding the nucleus of the atom are located and markings indicating the electron.at each level. A molecule is the smallest thing a substance can be divided into while remaining the same substance. It is made up of two or more atoms that are bound together by chemical bonding.
<br>

<u>What are Atoms made of?</u><br>

An atom is composed of three particles, namely,  neutrons, protons and electrons with hydrogen as an exception without neutrons.

    Every atom has a nucleus that bounds one or more electrons around it.
    The nucleus has typically a similar number of protons and neutrons which are together known as nucleons.
    The protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged and neutrons are neutral.

                Semiconductors are the materials which have a conductivity between conductors (generally metals) and non-conductors or insulators (such as ceramics). Semiconductors can be compounds such as gallium arsenide or pure elements, such as germanium or silicon. Physics explains the theories, properties and mathematical approach governing semiconductors.

                Examples of Semiconductors:
                
                Gallium arsenide, germanium, and silicon are some of the most commonly used semiconductors. Silicon is used in electronic circuit fabrication and gallium arsenide is used in solar cells, laser diodes, etc.<br>

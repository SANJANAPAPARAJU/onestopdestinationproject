                            Our planet is gifted with numerous living organisms, which vary in their size, shape, habitat, nutrition, reproduction and a lot more. Based on their physical features and their habitat, these animals of Kingdom Animale are classified into different order and class.
                            <br>
                            <u>Basis Of Classification</u><br>
                
                                Over millions of years, we have seen diversity in living beings. We have evolved from ape-like beings to homo sapiens. We look for similarities between organisms so that we can classify them into classes and hence study them as a whole, for this, fundamental characteristics need to be decided which would form the foundation for classifying.<br>
                                
                                Classification can be carried out based on many factors such as:<br>
                                
                                   <br> Presence of nucleus
                                
                                  <br>  Body design – make up of cells(Single-celled or Multicellular organisms)
                                
                                   <br> Production of food
                                
                                   <br> Level of the organization in bodies of organisms carrying out photosynthesis
                                
                                   <br> In animals – an organization of one’s body parts, development of body, specialized organs for different functions
                                
                                <br>These features can differ in both plants and animals as they differ in their body design. Hence, these prominent designs and characteristic features can be used to make subgroups and not aa broad classification.<br>
                
                                <u>Classification System</u><br>
                
                                   <br> The classification system is of two types:
                                    
                                  <br> Two-Kingdom Classification- This system was proposed by Carolus Linnaeus who classified organisms into two types- plants and animals.
                                    
                                 <br>   Five-Kingdom Classification- This kingdom was proposed by H.Whittaker who divided the organisms into five different classes:

                                        We need energy to perform various activities. This energy is derived from the catabolism of various components of food, e.g. proteins, carbohydrates, fats, etc. Oxygen is required for catabolic processes and carbon dioxide is released in the process. So the body requires a continuous exchange of gases, oxygen from the atmosphere is taken inside and carbon dioxide produced is taken out. This process of gaseous exchange is called breathing or respiration.
                                        <br>
                                        All the animals have different organs specialised for the gaseous exchange.<br>
                                        <u>Human Respiratory System</u><br>

                                            Conducting part of the respiratory system:
                                            <br>
                                            Nostrils → Pharynx (common passage for food and air) → Larynx (also called Soundbox, epiglottis prevents food from entering larynx) → Trachea (divides at 5th thoracic vertebra) → Primary Bronchi (Right and left) → Secondary and tertiary bronchi → Bronchioles (terminal)
                                            <br>
                                         
                                            
                                            Bronchioles form many bag-like structures terminally, which are known as alveoli. Alveoli and alveolar ducts together take part in the exchange of gases.
                                            <br>
                                            Bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli together constitute a lung. Each lung is covered by the pleural membrane. It is a double-layered membrane, pleural fluid is present between the two layers, which reduces friction.
                                            <br>
                                            Lungs reside in the thoracic cavity, which is formed by the vertebral column (dorsal surface), sternum (ventral surface), ribs (present laterally) and diaphragm present at the lower side.<br>

                                                <u id="is">3.IMMUNE SYSTEM</u><br>
                                               <u> What is Immunity?</u><br>

                                                Immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself against disease-causing organisms. Everyday our body comes in contact with several pathogens, but only a few results into diseases. The reason is, our body has the ability to release antibodies against these pathogens and protects the body against diseases. This defence mechanism is called immunity.<br>
                                                <u>Types of Immunity</u><br>

                                                    There are two major types of immunity:
                                                    <br>
                                                        Innate Immunity or Natural or Non-specific Immunity.
                                                    <br>
                                                        Acquired Immunity or Adaptive Immunity.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Innate Immunity
                                                    
                                                    This type of immunity is present in an organism by birth.
                                                    <br>
                                                    This is activated immediately when the pathogen attacks. Innate immunity includes certain barriers and defence mechanisms that keep foreign particles out of the body.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Innate immunity refers to the body’s defence system.
                                                    <br>
                                            
                                                    It is a long-term immunity in which our body produces the antibodies on its own. Our body has few natural barriers to prevent the entry of pathogens.<br>

<u>What is Genetics?</u><br>

    Genetics is termed as the study to understand the functioning of inheritance of traits from parents to offspring. The groundwork on which heredity stands is known as inheritance. It is defined as the procedure by which characteristics are handed down from one generation to the other. Gregor Johann Mendel is known as the “Father of Modern Genetics” for his discoveries on the basic principles of heredity.
    <br>
    Variation, as the name suggests is the amount of dissimilarity that exists between children and their parentages. It can be determined to keep in view the behaviouristic, cytological, physiological, and morphological characters of individuals fitting into similar species.
    <br>
    Some of the major reasons that variation are
    <br>
       <br> Genetic/Chromosomal rearrangement.
      <br>  Mutated genes due to the influence of the ecosystem.
      <br>  Crossing over.

    <u id="mhw">5.MICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE </u><br>
 

    We live in an environment that is abundant with different kinds of plants, animals and microorganisms around us.  People usually assume that microbes would cause harm to them in a different manner and hence one should stay away from them.  This argument is not true in its entirety as there are plenty of microbes that help humans knowingly or unknowingly. Here we will discuss the benefits that these tiny organisms provide to humans in particular.<br>
   <u> Benefits And Uses</u><br>
    
    Used In Vaccines, Antibiotics, And Industrial Products
    <br>
    The microbes are highly useful for making vaccines and antibiotics for making medicines. It is a well-known fact that harmful pathogens that cause different diseases by infecting our body.  The antibiotics and medicines would help us in fighting these diseases and infections. For instance, fungi and bacteria help in the production of antibiotics like streptomycin and tetracycline. The first antibiotic ever to have been discovered viz.  Penicillin by Alexander Flemming is made from fungi. The vaccines have microbes in the inactive mode ready to combat a particular disease and would aid in antibody development. There are plenty of vaccines made from microbial influence for diseases like tuberculosis, small pox, cholera, hepatitis.
    <br>
   <u> Useful In Making Products For Households</u><br>
    
    These tiny organisms would be helpful in different household activities like preparing food items. For instance, the curd is produced from milk by the influence of bacteria called lactobacillus. These bacteria work on milk by forming lactic acid which would break the milk protein and coagulate it to make curd. To form curd, a small amount of curd needs to be mixed with milk to initiate the process.
    <br>
    Another process called fermentation is behind the formation of alcohol from sugar. This process is conducted without the influence of oxygen. Hence it is an anaerobic process and it was discovered by Louis Pasteur. Food items like bread are made by a yeast that is fermented called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also, cheese is formed by fermentation by bacteria called Propionibacterium Sharmanii.
    <br>
    <u>As Agents For Biocontrol</u><br>
    
    For controlling pests and insects, a bacterium named Bacillus thuringiensis is used on a large scale basis. This bacteria would paralyze the insect/pest gut that intakes it.  For restricting plant pathogens, a fungi named Trichoderma is used.  There are certain types of viruses known as Baculoviruses that are deployed against insects and anthropods. Also, these microorganisms are used for making bio-fertilizers. Legume plants have their nitrogen fixation done by the bacteria called Rhizobium.
    <br>
    From the above discussion, one would have realized that fact that it is nearly impossible for humans to imagine a life without the support of beneficial microbes in particular.<br>
